# Steinway B-211
<p align="center">
  A free sample library of a real Steinway B-211 from 1960.
  <br>
  Probably the only realistic sample library I've ever made.
  <br><br>
  Preview of the sample library available on SoundCloud:

## Description
Do you want to just play standard MIDI files with piano samples, without having to pay for them?
<br>
Well, this is the right project for you!
<br><br>
Welcome to the Keppy's Steinway Piano project page on GitHub, where you can download a piano soundfont for free!
<br><br>
Please consider adding these lines to your video's description, to support the SoundFont:
<br>
"This soundfont was made by KaleidonKep99, you can find it here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Steinway-B-211"

## F.A.Q.
**I just want a ready-to-use sample library, without having to add fancypants effects to it. Is this project good for me?**
<br>
No. I recommend to search somewhere else, this is not the project for you.
<br><br>
**This sample library sounds terrible with Black MIDIs, like for real... Why don't you [...]**
<br>
This sample library is not meant for Black MIDIs anyway. How many times do I have to say that...

## Main features
- Sampled from a Steinway B-211.
- HQ samples, WAV 16bit, 128-point sinc, 1536kbps.
- Dynamic filtering, to emulate key pressures.
- Multiple presets for all the tastes!
- Can be edited as pleased with a generic notepad program! (Even the one built-in on Windows)

## Requests from the project's creator
1. If you want to publish it on your website, you can embed the page through an IFRAME tag or by inserting a direct link to this page. Please don't use direct download links.
3. Please don't implement these samples in your personal soundfonts.

## Read this part or do a barrel roll
Please don't complain about the samples being flat or stuff like that.
<br>
This soundfont has been made to give professional users a 360Â° field of view on B-211's sound, which they can tweak as they desire.
<br>
If you don't know how to do stuff like that, or you're just too lazy to do that, **please** refrain from using this project, and go somewhere else.

## Why is it on GitHub?
As I said before, Keppy Studios has been closed, but I didn't want to kill this project.
<br>
So I gave it another chance, and moved it to GitHub.
<br><br>
Have fun.
