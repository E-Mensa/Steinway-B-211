# Steinway B-211
A free soundfont of a real Steinway B-211 from 1960.
<br>
Probably the only realistic soundfont I've ever made.

# F.A.Q.
## I just want a ready-to-use soundfont, without having to add fancypants effects to it. Is this project good for me?
No. I recommend to search somewhere else, this is not the project for you.

## I'm searching for a "jazzy" soundfont, where can I find one?
Probably not here. There's Keppy's Steinway Piano for that, click here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Keppy-Steinway-Piano

# Description
## Main features
- Sampled from a Steinway B-211.
- HQ samples, WAV 16bit, 128-point sinc, 1536kbps.
- Dynamic filtering, to emulate key pressures.
- Multiple presets for all the tastes!
- Can be edited as pleased with a generic notepad program! (Even the one built-in on Windows)

## Rules for the use of this project
1. You can mix this soundfont with other GM soundfonts, but not with other piano soundfonts. This applies to other soundfonts of mine too. (Ex. Mixing this soundfont with the Roland Dream Piano)
2. Give us proper credits if you're going to use it in musical projects or YouTube videos. Add these lines to your description: "This soundfont was made by KaleidonKep99, you can find it here: https://github.com/KaleidonKep99/Steinway-B-211".
3. If you want to publish it on your website, you can embed the page through an IFRAME tag or by inserting a direct link to this page. Never use direct download links. NEVER.
4. You are allowed to add effects to the rendered audio (Ex. Rendering audio through SynthFont2 and then adding multiple effects, such as reverb and chorus, through FL Studio), but you're not allowed to come to the point where the effects cover the original sound (E.g. Making it sound like an Hapsicord or something like that).
5. Don't implement these samples in your personal soundfonts.

Please don't complain about the samples being flat or stuff like that.
<br>
This soundfont has been made to give professional users a 360Â° field of view on B-211's sound, which they can tweak as they desire.
<br>
If you don't know how to do stuff like that, or you're just too lazy to do that, **please** refrain from using this project, and go somewhere else.

# Why is it on GitHub?
As I said before, Keppy Studios has been closed, but I didn't want to kill this project.
<br>
So I gave it another chance, and moved it to GitHub.

Have fun.
